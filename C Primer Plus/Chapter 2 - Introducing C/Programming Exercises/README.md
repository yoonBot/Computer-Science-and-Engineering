# <h1 align='center'> C Primer Plus Chapter 2 Programming Exercise Problems

#### `1.` Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to printf your first and last names on one line. The output should look like this (but using your name):

###### Anton Bruckner <- First print statement
###### Anton          <- Second print statement
###### Bruckner       <- Still the second print statement
###### Anton Bruckner <- Third and fourth print statements

#### `2.` Write a program to print your name and address.

#### `3.` Write a program that converts your age in years to days and displays both values. At this point, don't worry about fractional years and leap years.

#### `4.` Write a program that produces the following output:

###### For he's a jolly good fellow!
###### For he's a jolly good fellow!
###### For he's a jolly good fellow!
###### Which nobody can deny!

#### have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main(): one that prints the "jolly good" message once, and one that prints the final line once.

#### `5.` Write a program that creates an integer variable called "toes". Have the program set toes to 10. Also have the program calculate what twice "toes" is and what "toes" squared is. The program should print all three values, identifying them. 

#### `6.` Write a program that produces the following output:

###### Smile!Smile!Smile!
###### Smile!Smile!
###### Smile!

#### Have the program define a function that displays the string "Smile!" once, and have the program use the function as often as needed.

#### `7.` Write a program that calls a function named one_three(). This function should display the word "one" on one line, call the function two(), and then display the word "three" on one line. The function two() should display the word "two" on one line. The main() function should display the phrase "starting now:" before calling one_three() and display "done!" after calling it. Thus, the output should look like the following:

###### starting now:
###### one
###### two
###### three
###### done!
