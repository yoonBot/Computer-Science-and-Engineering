# <center> Chapter 2 Programming Exercise Problems

#### 1. Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to printf your first and last names on one line. The output should look like this (but using your name):

###### Anton Bruckner <- First print statement
###### Anton          <- Second print statement
###### Bruckner       <- Still the second print statement
###### Anton Bruckner <- Third and fourth print statements
