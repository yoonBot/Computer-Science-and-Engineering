# <center> Chapter 2 Programming Exercise Problems

#### 1. Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to printf your first and last names on one line. The output should look like this (but using your name):

###### Anton Bruckner <- First print statement
###### Anton          <- Second print statement
###### Bruckner       <- Still the second print statement
###### Anton Bruckner <- Third and fourth print statements

#### 2. Write a program to print your name and address.

#### 3. Write a program that converts your age in years to days and displays both values. At this point, don't worry about fractional years and leap years.

#### 4. Write a program that produces the following output:

###### For he's a jolly good fellow!
###### For he's a jolly good fellow!
###### For he's a jolly good fellow!
###### Which nobody can deny!

#### have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main(): one that prints the "jolly good" message once, and one that prints the final line once.
