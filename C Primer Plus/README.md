#### **`Note: `**

##### 1. Each chapter directory contains example source codes mentioned from each chapter
##### 2. Each chapter directory also contains the programming exercises, which are located at the end of each chapter, right after the review questions.
##### 3. Majority of the source codes for each programming exercise are thought up by me, so there are actually multiple ways to solve each question.
##### 4. Again, you should develop your own source code as it forces you to think.
