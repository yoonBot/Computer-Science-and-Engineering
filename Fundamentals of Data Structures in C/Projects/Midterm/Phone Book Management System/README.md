[ GOAL/ACCOMPLISHMENTS ] : 
  
  Given contact names, phonebooks, and email addresses, we hope to
  develop a simple phone book management system that handles the following features and
  user interfaces:

  1. Reads and inputs the users' names, their phone numbers, and their email addresses 
     from the input text file.
  2. Prints and displays the list of currently saved the users' contacts onto console.
  3. Sorts the currently saved contacts in alphabetical order.
  4. Allows the user to search an individual contact throughout the list.
  5. Delete an individual contact (saves it into trash bin).
  6. Recover one recently deleted individual contact from the trash bin.




[ ALGORITHMS ]
  
  To accomplish such features, we will use and implement the following algorithms:
  
    1. Linked Lists
      - Connects and saves each individual's contact information into a single node.
 
    2. Dynamic array Stacks and Queues
      - If the trash bin is full (the storage where the deleted nodes are stacked), 
        bin storage will increase twice.
      
    3. KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm
      - Helps user find the searched node (the characters of the users'names).
      
    4. Merge Sort
      - This ultimately sorts the contact list in alphabetical order.
