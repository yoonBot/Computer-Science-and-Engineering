#### **`0. What's in this Repository? >`**
##### 1. My personal intepretations of each algorithm along with each pseudocode
##### 2. My source codes implementing those algorithms and slight alterations using both C and C++ programming language

#### **`1. Notes and Reminders`**
##### 1. I have explained each algorithm as simple as I can, so those who know basic C/C++ syntax will easily be able to understand each pseudocode and thorough explanations
##### 2. I have indeed included not only C but C++ source files because PS (Problem Solving) mostly uses C++ anyways, than C.
##### 3. Although Pseudocode and Algorithms are mostly the same for both programming languages, there are some parts that are different, so I have included C++ so that I, and perhaps you, can learn about each of their respective differences.
