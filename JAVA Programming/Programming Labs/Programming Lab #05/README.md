#### **`05-1. String Comparison >`**

##### * What will be printed on the display when you execute this program? (Refer to source code)
##### - Guess first, and then run this program and see the result for yourself.

#### **`05-2. Input and Output >`**

##### - Write a Java program that asks for name of the user and prints a string.
###### - First, the program should print "What is your name?".
###### - Then, the program should wait for user input and store it in a variable "name".
###### - Then, the program should print "Hello! 'name'".

#### **`05-3. If Statement >`**

##### * Write a Java program that does the following.
###### - Draw a random integer n in the range [-200, 200], and print "random number: n".
###### - On the second line, 
###### a. if n > 100, print "more than 100".
###### b. if 0 <= n <= 100, print "0 ~ 100".
###### c. if -100 <= n < 0, print "-100 ~ -1".
###### d. if n < -100, print "less than -100".

#### **'05-4. For Loop >`**

##### * Write a Java program that does the following.
###### - On the first line, print numbers from 1 to 10.
###### - On the second line, print the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
###### - Use for loop to achieve the goal. 

#### **`05-5. While Loop >`**

##### * Write a Java program that does the following.
###### - Print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.
###### - Use while loop to achieve the goal.

#### **`05-6. Do-While Loop >`**

##### * Write a Java program that does the following.
###### - Print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100. (The same goal as previous problem)
###### - Use do-while loop to achieve the goal.

#### **`05-7. Switch Statement >`**

##### * Write a Java program that does the following.
###### - Draw a random number from 1 to 100 and print the number.
###### - Divide the number by 5 and get the remainder r. Print "n % 5: r".
###### - If the remainder is 0, print "remainder is zero."
###### - Else if the remainder is 1, print "remainder is one."
###### - Else if the remainder is 2, print "remainder is two."
###### - Otherwise, print "remainder is three or four."
###### - Use switch statement to achieve the goal.

#### **`05-8. Break & Continue >`**

##### - Write a Java program that does the following.
###### - Draw a random number from 0 to 99 and print the number.
###### - If 0 is drawn, finish the program.
###### - If a number among 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 is drawn, don't print the number and repeat.
###### - Otherwise, print the number and repeat.
###### - Use the keyword break and continue to achieve the goal.
