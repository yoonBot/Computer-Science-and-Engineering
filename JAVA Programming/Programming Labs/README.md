#### **`Reminders: >`** :exclamation:

##### 1. Majority of the lab instructions are to run the programs given from lecture slides. Rarely would you have to solve the algorithms by yourself.
##### 2. However, you should, as each instruction notes, predict the output of each program before compilation. 
##### 3. Be sure to completely understand each program and understand why such outputs are presented.
