# <center> CSE3040 Java Programming (Fall 2020) - Programming Lab #02

### 02-1. Length of a String

##### * Write a Java program that prints the following on the screen.
###### - The first line should print "Hello, World!"
###### - The second line should print the length of the string, "Hello, World!".

### 02-2. Random Number Generation

##### * Write a Java program that prints 5 random integers on the screen.

### 02-3. Primitive Types

##### * The following Java code produces unexpected output. Modify the code so that it produces the result as expected (print values from 125 to 134.)

###### public class Ex02_3 {
###### __public static void main (String[] args) {
###### ____// print values from 125 to 134
###### ____byte b = 125;
###### ____for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
###### ______System.out.print(" " + b++);
###### ____System.out.println();
###### __}
###### }

### 02-4. Float vs. Double

##### * Compare the two results and understand why the results are produced that way. (Examine source code for further details.)

### 02-5. Boolean
