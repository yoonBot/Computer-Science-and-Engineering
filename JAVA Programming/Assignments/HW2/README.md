# <center> CSE3040: Java Programming (Fall 2020) Homework 2

#### Problem 6 (20 points)

##### * We would like to write a Java program that prints the Fibonacci sequence. The definition of Fibonacci sequence is as follows.
##### F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
##### So starting from F(0), the sequence will be as follows:
##### 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610...
##### * In order to fullfill the goal, we have implemented a part of the code. Complete the program so that the program runs correctly and produces the expected output.
