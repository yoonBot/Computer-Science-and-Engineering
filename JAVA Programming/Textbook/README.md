#### 1. I have provided two versions of the textbook: The first one is empty and untouched. The other one has been annotated and highlighted. Feel free to access the second version as well to see what parts of the textbook have been personally significant and resonated to me.
#### 2. Note that when accessing the annotated version, I have highlighted parts that were personally significant. Majority of these portions are either not mentioned throughout the lecture slides or significant details that add up to the lecture slides.
#### 3. Even though you might pay attention to the highlighted parts of the text, be sure to still read through the not hightlighted portions. They do provide background.
#### 4. You should still type the source codes yourself, rather than download from other people's repositories. 
#### 5. Be sure to solve the Programming Exercises provided at the end of each chapter.
